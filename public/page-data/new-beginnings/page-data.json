People gathered on either side of these fighting customers backing either of the customers, but as people started backing on each side, their confidence is also backed ,boosted and when one insulted the other, it is multiplied with the number of people on both sides and at once brawls between them. But for now we don’t need the reason for the brawls to judge the morally winning side, only after looking into the incidents that happened in the past,  we could understand this situation better. So, let’s back to the future for sometime and leave this absurdity here. </p>\n<p>A point of origin or anything which is understood as The God sets the universe in motion for no particular reason, has to maintain order,peace and prosperity in the world. So it recruits some messengers through the ages to state the living morale to the humans,as the god who managed this universe over 13.8 billion years was unable to run the life on earth and they are called The Prophets. </p>\n<p>In around 2000 BCE, It was in Alaska, almost at the leftmost part of the world, ​a man who thought that he was the chosen one to deliver the message sent by  the god, Kqowin. He then converted all of the morale and knowledge transmitted by the  ultimate or he could have devised his own principles to imbibe his ideologies into a  scripture, religious scripture named as Kqow. Like all the religion nowadays, Kqowin’s  religion has main theme as 1] There is one god and that is Kqow   2] Thou did good go to heaven, bad to hell 3] Service to others is the ultimate path to  heaven. These were the main themes in short of the kqow religion. But, it has many  verses, in which it also happens to have something related to the brawls that is  happening beside Dr.Wilheim. At that time, In Kqowin’s village they have found that they  have a warm land to cultivate brinjal as their neighbouring villages from which they have  acquired the seedlings. During their first harvesting times due to their warm lands every  brinjal is par in size and quality. But, after consuming those yields the villagers gets \naffected by skin problems such as anaphylaxis,where skin rashes, vomiting, diarrhea,  stomach cramp, hives occurs and this could happen instantly after the consumption,  leads to death at many cases and they stopped the cultivation of brinjal. All these were  witnessed by Kqowin, added to his scripture that brinjal as a  “​Saquo Bies​’ ’ which  means “Devil’s Berry”,  plantation or selling of poor brinjal is considered to be a sin.      After 1000 years around 1000 BCE, It was in east of the Russia, almost at  the right most part of the world, another man thought to be a prophet to a new  religion,​Adelaida and the religion was Adelain, His main theme of the religion are 1] All the things happen in the world are under lord’s control. 2] Do the duty to the need and don’t expect the return. 3] Every action has its results. And these are the shorter version of the adelain’s main motive. Don’t be surprised to see both the shown religion’s core as the same, because almost all the religions have the same core with some other their own implications, either god’s or the prophet’s.This religious scripture also has to do with the brawls happening beside Dr.Wilheim. Adelaida’s village never had the ill effects or anything that happened in Kqowin’s village. But, this village never had so many plantations apart from wheat, cereals, pulses, brinjal and some other vegetation. Villagers considered brinjal to be sacred,because most of the farmers and people depended on brinjal for their livelihood and was witnessed by Adelaida. He included this into his scripture and thus quoted brinjal as “Bawash” which means “Holy Saviour”.  </p>\n<p>Let’s come to the present to see the apparent absurd reason for the brawls, at the centre of the world,beside Dr.Wilheim. It’s 2020 AD, a time where both the above mentioned religions have infiltrated into many parts of the world and German is of no exception to that. As people had a sense of hope that they could rely upon those religions, prayed to their well being and took everything described in those scripture as pure. And as you can imagine, what happened in the market as follows: </p>\n<p>Vendor was sitting amidst all the vegetables around him. </p>\n<p>Qowinin: “Where can i get the baskets” Vendor: “It’s right behind you beneath the box” Qowinin: “Thank you,i’ll be right back in a second” Vendor: “What do you need sir” Adel: “Oh Well, His Holiness, Bawash, 2 kg” Qowinin: “Oh cursed,Saquo Bies, i didn’t see this, i would’ve not come to this shop”  Adel: “You don’t know the divinity, Donkey does not know the smell of camphor, man” Qowinin: “Oh then ofcourse, rats does” Random Guy: “We know how wicked you people are..”\nAnother random Guy: “And merciful too, otherwise by now you would be beaten to a pulp” Random Guy: “And, let’s see who gets beaten up” </p>\n<p>There standing Dr.Wilheim beside them watching these brawls says ”Brinjal is neither sacred nor devil, it has histamines, which triggers allergy and that’s it. Those who are prone to these allergies can avoid and apart from that it has a good nutritional value it can be consumed.Understood” to roxy. </p>\n<p>Roxy barked against those brawling people.  </p>\n<p>Dr.Wilheim: “They don’t understand roxy, And now i understood that those people are allergic, roxy.” </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/92c6c3becdc24cbf7756715e2f10bd55/1d69c/oldman.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAEbklEQVQ4y4VUa0ybVRg+3aZEjMR/Ll7+aAiZu7pMVDCLSoABg9WVi6PtGOUil0Iv3NrSr/cbvd++0lIuBVraQqGsXGSAsAnTbdkSL1litsxodMYFNdPFOVfoke/gbPgBnD/vyXue98n7nPc5B4Bt1rTPDQI9jl3EPtjbuS/gtv3g77LOj3l6Eohcr0ULliIhcPPaMthxzQX6UAwYxYjQb8De9Mmb4JCc+9sTzNJwHzqbC/btTBjENSjKK0+jIoOwITssYkaHpey/PXYdC0L4NJG/sTBDIuLlidDOpJE+OyK7HAmcsmAs6LeooVstXAu7zXBx1Bcmzmhph8DV+QgYMMu3Jko7dhRMDHSi/Xe3v90z3mW61d/RDn12bTTo0MVcCn407DLBL6ZGPyQws/6e3dt2NjnUDUYdWtRdyKHdP6ATPRzBO6DPIIr5TFLoNStWg1YlHMZ1VwhMK+UEmPa6tpc7bFchwhFcne6QNEGfSRYbsshigwZJLGBTx5TcauiQtj5eDHkOE7hwt3XXlmSLlxbAeJcBybgw6Ch2KVpgt4oXHTJLY9514n6DOGZqZ616NBjs1QhzkYU02Nayx5x60CNvQQC/USJxSpsQodcogd51yR69aG1QL4ZBq+ofP65KIXCjLh1pa8vYVGBAzUeEPp0I85ulcMimjPZrhUj6+kRjEYt01S9rshEY+PtdUgPlgzjBjFcDfvncjfZffoKDq4NtINDagO4kwKlP84ua4Qiugl6DeG19KNFxlx52YR/fSSeBpCs/QtSZ8ExGnBA3KjZ857P+n5s3cDZeSB45ycusstn4tX8G9BgcsymgW8mDVh5j4qbglacIjKmeDNaNvlmmv1uHIoQjux+vfJ3wJH9DJnjBIxa/2ibg/8Suq16TY4K7gg7TH2111Cx3xfGXCYy5Jp/USE6Pk3k7VajtFqH4uYsjlqUFK+PWRUPRG99MDCfNSU2JYH9BAt/kXMkpq7tXwpFNafpD99uY5w7oaW+9TtR1lL9PolHpcUKrToJifqXkmfM9sq8WjBXwMwfnwbK5+v6yugBD5tVYVnJoNb+eqmqZZinNsI7ZkCfPS0lG91eUTmJTmJslnzfX7kHPyFblvGRhwFnt2UfXDGT4qSr/ziDe/jxXbf+5mC1fyaSz8TMcyaNyGv1tXs4RZBluwbubLWPUKsAsXoWGcMHJos7aK+BURyEMKygPI+qSv2acjVlnhZbvi9my28cLq8SZZZwH1JOZrzXlHkWSG7NTSM3l8YGCHi0ThPSVG29XV5HqU1U0DrSTm3uFRQNdPDKHyJe0ma5nVWGz71EY4iw6B9Jr2MdaMpL3rU8RCE4A0JCXFyeknc4AU70S1PZkN5a6MNZ5GK9PPdTZnOs2NWSg8dVjHdfpjYJ7FbXMc9x2KeQKlbm8dxKT+Yxi5Aj+yYOb73BmSP/ft294aS5o3tsp/OgAjtGzJ+2sZymlpXsLS2kRMqUwTKcWvZhLLpwrpFYerCRnppVR8hOJOsbpHFT/L/CUAoFoUVQ+AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Man who knows\"\n        title=\"Man who knows\"\n        src=\"/static/92c6c3becdc24cbf7756715e2f10bd55/0a47e/oldman.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/92c6c3becdc24cbf7756715e2f10bd55/8a4e8/oldman.png 150w,\n/static/92c6c3becdc24cbf7756715e2f10bd55/5a46d/oldman.png 300w,\n/static/92c6c3becdc24cbf7756715e2f10bd55/0a47e/oldman.png 600w,\n/static/92c6c3becdc24cbf7756715e2f10bd55/1d69c/oldman.png 750w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Prophets & Brinjal - Short Story","date":"April 17, 2020","description":"Satire meta fiction"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/The Wave/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Wave - Short Film"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Prophets & Brinjal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Prophets & Brinjal - Short Story"}}}}}
