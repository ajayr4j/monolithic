### Making Experience:
My first ever film making experience, writing part was completed in an hour, with what I some days back imagined about the concept, but making the film was very taxing as it was shot on the verge of the beach(Thiruvattiyur) we coudn't expect the tide to be in our way, it's my mistake that I wanted to make a film about something as im interested in film-making, I should have choosen a single room drama or something like that for a first timer.

Somehow, My friend Rajesh accepted to  do cinematography, then I stayed in his home, then we went there considering ourselves as crew, Well cast,we went a day prior to the location and we asked the locals to act in the film, They were all kind to us to spend some time near by their home, but the output we got in the first day shoot was horrible as it's the first time for us too, We were scared, and we took out the portion out(It was actually usefull for the film as a whole), and the next day morning we are riding in the motorcycle at 5AM in the morning for a 50 Kilometers(Rajesh's Home - Beach) ride, at that time i felt a low that couldn't be expressed, we don't have the cast to act in what we are going to shoot that day, we just went and saw a small boy(Jeevanandham) roaming there, he accepted then after shooting that day, the next day with an elder person we completed the shoot and throughout the course of shooting we fell in the ditches that connecting sewage and beach, witnessed the process of fishing, the locals hardships and the next day with few of my other friends Muthu, abinaya we shot some montages.And then, my friend Vasu edited the film.Then I felt accomplished and that's the unmatchable feel that couldn't be expressed.
